# Genetic-A-Pathfinding-Algorithm
A hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) + A* pathfinding system that evolves heuristics to optimize search performance on complex grids.  This project explores how evolutionary algorithms can learn better heuristics for classical graph search, reducing node expansions and improving path quality under varying obstacle densities.
